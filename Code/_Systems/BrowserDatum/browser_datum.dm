/*
	Yet another iteration of browser datum,
	Mostly I want this one to be more clear to actually mess with and look at.... welp
	If you put a html file in the attached_external_files it'll just attempt to load that in instead of anything else.
	Also heres a todo: browser page updating that isn't a full reload.
